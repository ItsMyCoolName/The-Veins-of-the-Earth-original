KNOWN ISSUES

The lower left corner display is weird on the first turn of the game. Move and the values will be normal.
Item descriptions do not show up.
Encumbrance doesn't work.
Potions cannot be used due to the 'being worn' requirement somewhere.

Leveling up only grants hp until we figure out how to do class-based attack and save bonuses.
The grimlock should be permanently blind.
You can currently bash with your bow for the same damage it deals normally.
There is no -4 penalty for using weapons you are not proficient in.

Shooting currently uses your Strength to determine attack.
