KNOWN ISSUES

The lower left corner display is weird on the first turn of the game. Move and the values will be normal.
Item descriptions do not show up.
Encumbrance doesn't work.
Potions cannot be used due to the 'being worn' requirement somewhere.
Highscores do not work.

Leveling up only grants hp until we figure out how to do class-based attack and save bonuses.



Shooting currently uses your Strength to determine attack.
