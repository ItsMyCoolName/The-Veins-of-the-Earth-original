return [[You can fire arrows or sling stones. These allow you to hit from afar.
Casting spells is pretty similar, but don't let a mage hear you say this!

You have been given a bow, which you wield with both hands. You also have some arrows, but please do not waste them!
To fire an arrow, use the shoot talent. The target interface will pop-up, just like for other talents.

To equip your bow and arrows:
* Open your inventory.
* Select your bow and arrows, wield them.

There are spiders to the west. Go use your bow and arrows to kill them!
