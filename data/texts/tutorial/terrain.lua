return [[During your adventures you will walk a variety of terrains: stone floor, grass, sand, water, lava ...

Some of those terrains have hidden penalties or tricks. You will have to learn every one of them and how to deal with them.

You are about to enter a pond of water; take care, if you inhale water you'll get hurt. I hope you can swim!

Now go to the other side of the pond.
