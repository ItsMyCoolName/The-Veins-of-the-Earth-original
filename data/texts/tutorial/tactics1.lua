return [[You have found a nest of spiders! If you let them surround you, you might be in trouble!
A basic tactic is to never get surrounded, do not hesitate to backtrack a bit to a safer spot.

#GOLD#Always control the fight.#WHITE#

After the combat you will probably be low on health, you can rest for a while to regain lost health and resources.
If you lose all your health, you'll start suffering hits to your wounds, and running out of wounds will kill you.

'R' rests. You will rest for a period of time or until a creature disturbs you. Resting allows you to regain lost health and one wound.

Now take a few steps back so you only have to fight one spider at a time, and you should survive.
Remember to use all your abilities to win the fight.
