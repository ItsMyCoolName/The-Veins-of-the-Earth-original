return [[#GOLD#Congratulations !#WHITE#

You have completed this small tutorial, and should now know the basics of the game. You are ready to step forward into the world to find glory, treasures and be mercilessly slaughtered by hordes of creatures you thought you could handle!
During this tutorial some creatures were adjusted to the need of the teachings.

If you need a reminder of which key does what, you can access the game menu by pressing #GOLD#Escape#WHITE# and checking the key binds (you can also adjust them to your needs).

Now go boldly and remember: #GOLD#Have fun!#WHITE#
Press Escape, save & exit and create a new character!
