The Veins of the Earth

Various branches other than master contain WIP code which isn't working properly for some reason. Any help debugging it is welcome!

CONTRIBUTING

If you want to know how monsters, items, spells are coded - take a look at MODDING.md. Most of it is really easy and can be done via copy & pasting, too.

Just fork the repo, make your changes and then make a pull request back. There's a list of issues (bugs and ideas) available on Git (right-hand side panel).

DO NOT include anything that's not OGL - for example, no illithids or kuo-toa.

Anything that *IS* OGL - for example, SRD, Incursion, or the D&D Wiki portions marked as Open Game Content - is fine.

Any contributors will be credited in the Readme.
