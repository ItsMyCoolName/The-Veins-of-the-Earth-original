The Veins of the Earth
=========

The to-debug branch contains WIP code which isn't working properly for some reason. Any help debugging it is welcome!

CONTRIBUTING

Just fork the repo, make your changes and then make a pull request back. There's a list of issues (bugs and ideas) available on Git (right-hand side panel).

DO NOT include anything that's not OGL - for example, no illithids or kuo-toa.

Anything that *IS* OGL - for example, SRD, Incursion, or the D&D Wiki portions marked as Open Game Content - is fine.

Any contributors will be credited in the Readme.
